# Ugly_Animals_Memory_Game
My 3rd HTML/CSS + JS project, a memory game using cat pictures get from https://cataas.com API

# Conclusion :

- Game is working but there would be a lot of features to add so it becomes pleasant to play and has a real interest : like a timer, best player data storage in a DB like Firebase, being able to choose the size of the grid and make it a square or rectangle for any window size, etc...

# Things I learned :

- API Rest GET requests

- Asynchronous JS, which changed the entire structure of my program and made me understand why it can be nice to regroup stuff in classes

# Next stuff :

- Before using react I should improve myself in vanilla JS and discover TS (which I think I'll like because I'm used to the typed languages C/C++), I also would like to go further in API requests, using a more complexe API
